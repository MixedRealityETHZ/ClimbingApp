We developed a Mixed Reality application that improves the overall experience of learning rock-climbing. In a record mode the grasps of an expert are captured once for a specific route. Then, an amateur has holograms of the suggested grasps augmented in their field of view. Grasp detection and iterating through grasp holograms are the main functionalities enabling this method. The resulting application fulfills its goals and was stable in use. Testing showed that this approach was helpful and efficient for most users. In future works, foot tracking and multi device capabilities could be added. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qRYEteMUU)
